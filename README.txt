README file for CS174A Project 2 
By Hanjing Fang (604588300)
================================================================

This project satisfies all the requirements given:

·  [4 points] At least one two-level hierarchical object:
    — The arms and legs for Baymax

·  [4 points] At least one texture, either procedural or mapped:
    - Mapped texture for butterflies, the backgrounds, stones, textlines, etc. 

·  [4 points] Demonstrate manual camera fly-around using LookAt:
   - Cameras flies around several times in the animation, e.g. at the very beginning, at  
    the end, when Baymax is running, etc.

·  [6 points] Polygonal objects of your own (you must provide positions, normals, and   
   texture coordinates directly, by extending the Shape class), drawn in different places 
   using both flat shading and smooth shading variants of the Phong reflection model.
   - Butterfly wings, pure circles, cylinders, umbrellas are drawn by my own. Among them,
     I created two kind of umbrellas, which respectively shows flat shading and smooth 
     shading. 
   
·  [2 points] Real-time speed. Make sure that your animation runs at the same speed no  
   matter how fast of a machine your program runs on. “Real time” means that one simulated   
   second corresponds roughly to one real second.

·  [2 points] Display the frame rate of your program on the graphics window.

·  [2 points] Make and submit a movie of your animation using your favorite screen 
   recording application (camstudio/quicktime).  If your application is interactive, your   
   submission must be a video of it being used. You can add subtitles.  Make sure you 
   encode your movie to within 100MB.

·  [4 points] Creativity (story, colors, etc).
   - My animation tells a story about the friendship between Baymax and his butterfly 
   friend. When Baymax says he wants to fly with the butterfly(he tries hard but he 
   cannot), the butterfly calls his friends to realize his dream!

·  [4 points] Complexity.
   - I made this about 2-minute animation with over 1500 lines of code.

·  [5 points] Overall quality: Object and camera motion, scene construction, proper 
   texturing, attention to detail.
   - I paid a lot attention to the details, like how Baymax’s head moves, how its arms 
   moves and how Baymax interacts with butterflies.
